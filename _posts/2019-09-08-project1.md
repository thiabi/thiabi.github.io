title: Tuwaiq Data Science Bootcamp Project 1

08 Sep 2019.

Our first project of this boot camp was a data analysis for an international
organization called Yes Women Yes Tech (YWYS).
This organization is aiming to involve women more in technology, so
they reached out to us.
They are hosting a gala at the beginning of summer and they would like to sign
up people and sent them email invitations.
The organization provided us with data of the New York subway,and
asked us to provide them with the best location, which are the most crowded places.
